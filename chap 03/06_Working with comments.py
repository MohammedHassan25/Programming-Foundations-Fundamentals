# Comments are notes to your future self and others to describe what code does
# The comments do not impact the output of our code
# We can also use comments to help temporaily ignore some code

# for Example :-

print("Hi!")
name = input("What's your name? ")  # Asks the user name

# print("Welcome", name)
# answer = input("Are you reading books ? ")

# if answer == "Yes":
#     print("That's good")
# else:
#     print("Oh no! That's not good")
