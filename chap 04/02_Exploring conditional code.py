# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The most common way for a computer to make decisions is by means of an if statement
# An if statement in python starts with the word if
# it checks some conditions , if that condition is true, it will do the work
# When you click tab, the IDE automatically add four spaces to our code
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# for example :

if 5 < 6:
    print("yes, 5 is less than 6")

# The indentation in IF statement is very important

# for example
if 5 < 6:
    print("yes, 5 is less than 6")
    print("That's good")
print("Thank you")  # notice :- This is two statements in our block not three


print("Hi!")
name = input("What's your name? ")

print("Welcome", name)
answer = input("Are you reading books ? ")

if answer == "Yes":
    print("That's good")

print("Thank you for answer")
